# Train-Test-Split-Example-Python
The train test split is a common technique used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of a model on new and unseen data. This technique involves splitting a dataset into two parts: a training set used to train the model, and a testing set used to evaluate the model's performance. In this example, we will demonstrate how to split data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split() function from the sklearn.model_selection library in Python.

## Prerequisites
In order to run this script, you'll need to have the following installed:

Python 3.x
NumPy
scikit-learn

## Installing
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using https://github.com/EntimemaInsight/Train-Test-Split-Example-Python
2. Ensure that you have all the prerequisites installed (see above).
3. Run train_test_split.ipynb in a Jupyter notebook.

## Usage
The script train_test_split.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to split data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split() function. The script generates two numpy arrays (a and b) and splits them into training and testing sets.
To run the script, open the Jupyter notebook in your local machine and execute the cells. You can modify the script to use your own data or adjust the test size parameter to change the proportion of data used for testing.

## Conclusion
The train test split is a crucial technique in machine learning for evaluating the performance of a model on new and unseen data. By splitting the data into training and testing sets, we can assess the model's ability to generalize to new data. The train_test_split() function in the scikit-learn library makes it easy to split data in Python and is a valuable tool for machine learning practitioners.
