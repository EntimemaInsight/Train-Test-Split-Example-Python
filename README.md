# Train-Test-Split-Example-Python
This is a simple Python script that demonstrates how to split data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split() function from the sklearn.model_selection library. The script generates two numpy arrays (a and b) and splits them into training and testing sets.

## Prerequisites
In order to run this script, you'll need to have the following installed:

Python 3.x
NumPy
scikit-learn

## Installing
Clone this repository to your local machine using https://github.com/EntimemaInsight/Train-Test-Split-Example-Python
Ensure that you have all the prerequisites installed (see above).
Run train_test_split.ipynb in a Jupyter notebook.
